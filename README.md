This project is built using the **Laravel** PHP framework and focuses on securely managing employee information.  
It integrates multiple security components such as **Laravel Crypt** for encryption, **Google OTP** for two-factor authentication, and **Spatie Activity Log** for tracking user and system activities.  
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is implemented manually to maintain a lightweight and customized access control system.
